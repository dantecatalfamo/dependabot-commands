* Dependabot Commands
  A small userscript to make dealing with dependabot less painful.

  Adds buttons that will submit dependabot command comments with a
  single click.

  Only appears on pull requests that are opened by dependabot.

  Requires a userscript manager like [[https://violentmonkey.github.io/][Violentmonkey]] or [[https://www.greasespot.net/][Greasemonkey]] to
  be installed in your browser.

  Click [[https://github.com/dantecatalfamo/dependabot-commands/raw/master/dependabot-commands.user.js][here]] to add the script.
